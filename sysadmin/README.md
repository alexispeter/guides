Sysadmin
========

sysadmin@cargomedia.ch
----------------------
Gmail account which receives all emails sent to `root`.
- Emails are labeled by the environment and server they came from.
- Emails should always be archived, and not deleted.
- Please only archive emails if the topic is fully "settled" (i.e. Updates are installed or a bug report is opened etc).
- Please always archive emails that you are responsible for and that are fully "settled".

Working on production servers
-----------------------------
- Manual work on production servers should be avoided if possible. Work on staging environment, or a local VM instead.
- Before running commands which will alter configuration, please let someone review the exact commands you're going to execute.
- Announce work on production servers in the HipChat channel `Sysadmin`.
